# Introduction

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. In contrast to traditional supervised machine learning algorithms, K-Means attempts to classify data without having first been trained with labeled data. Once the algorithm has been run and the groups are defined, any new data can be easily assigned to the most relevant group.

For this project we will attempt to use K-Means Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public.

It is very important to note, we actually have the labels for this data set, but we will mot use them for the K-Means clustering algorithm, since that is an unsupervised learning algorithm.

When using the K-Means algorithm under normal circumstances, it is because you don't have labels. In this case we will use the labels to try to get an idea of how well the algorithm performed, but you won't usually do this for K-Means, so the classification report and confusion matrix at the end of this project, don't truly make sense in a real world setting!

# Problem Description

A dataset is formed by taking into consideration some of the information of 777 universities. Based on the given information about each university we have  to use K-Means Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of 777 universities data.
There are 18 columns in the dataset, however the first column name is not a good parameter as far as machine learning is considered so, there are effectively 17 columns.

- _Private_ - A factor with levels No and Yes indicating private or public university

- _Apps_ - Number of applications received

- _Accept_ - Number of applications accepted

- _Enroll_ - Number of new students enrolled

- _Top10perc_ - % of new students from top 10% of their high school class

- _Top25perc_ - % of new students from top 25% of their high school class

- _F.Undergrad_ - Number of full-time undergraduates

- _P.Undergrad_ - Number of part-time undergraduates

- _Outstate_ - Out-of-state tuition

- _Room.Board_ - Room and board costs

- _Books_ - Estimated book costs

- _Personal_ - Estimated personal spending

- _PhD_ - % of faculty with PhDs

- _Terminal_ - % of faculty with a terminal degree (PhD/JD/MD/MBA/etc)

- _S.F.Ratio_ - Student/faculty ratio

- _perc.alumni_ - % alumni who donate

- _Expend_ - Instructional expenditure per student

- _Grad.Rate_ - Graduation rate

# Technology
